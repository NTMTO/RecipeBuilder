**Concept rough draft**

System Overview

The system has two main components:

	1.	AI-Powered Kitchen Cameras
	•	Track the addition, removal, and usage of items in real-time.
	•	Focuses on high-traffic areas (fridge, pantry, counters).
	•	Uses advanced object recognition to update inventory passively.
	2.	Receipt/E-Receipt Parsing
	•	Provides a reliable baseline for initial inventory input.
	•	Ensures accuracy for packaged goods and bulk purchases.
	•	Supplements the camera system for tracking new purchases.

Implementation Steps

1. AI-Powered Kitchen Cameras

Hardware Design:

	•	Camera Placement: Strategically install cameras:
	•	Inside the fridge (e.g., door or shelves).
	•	Inside the pantry.
	•	Near countertops where groceries are typically unpacked or meals are prepared.
	•	Wide-Angle Cameras: Use wide-angle or fisheye lenses to maximize coverage.
	•	Low-Light Optimization: Ensure cameras work in dim lighting (e.g., fridge interiors).

Software Features:

	•	Object Recognition: Train a machine learning model to identify common grocery items and packaging.
	•	Pre-load the system with a large food dataset.
	•	Allow users to “teach” the system for rare or unique items.
	•	Activity Detection: Monitor patterns such as:
	•	Removing items (deduct from inventory).
	•	Returning items (update storage location).
	•	Leaving an item out for an extended period (trigger spoilage alerts).
	•	Time-Lapse Tracking: Aggregate daily data to refine predictions about consumption patterns.

Data Integration:

	•	Sync camera data with a central inventory database.
	•	Prioritize camera input for fresh produce or items without barcodes.

2. Receipt and E-Receipt Parsing

Receipt Scanning:

	•	Mobile App Feature: Allow users to snap pictures of physical receipts.
	•	Use OCR (e.g., Tesseract or Google Vision API) to extract product names, quantities, and prices.
	•	Match extracted items with a product database to auto-populate inventory.
	•	Error Correction: Provide users with a simple interface to correct any OCR errors.

E-Receipt Integration:

	•	Email Parsing: Link the app to users’ email accounts to auto-detect e-receipts.
	•	Use natural language processing (NLP) to extract purchase details from confirmation emails.
	•	API Integrations: Partner with grocery platforms like Instacart, Amazon Fresh, or Walmart to fetch e-receipt data directly.

Baseline Updates:

	•	Receipt data serves as the primary source of truth for initial inventory after shopping trips.
	•	Use receipt data to cross-verify camera inputs for accuracy.

Workflow

	1.	New Purchases:
	•	User buys groceries in-store or online.
	•	Receipt or e-receipt parsing updates the inventory.
	•	Cameras confirm items as they are put away, resolving discrepancies like missing items.
	2.	Ongoing Tracking:
	•	Cameras monitor item usage, movement, and depletion.
	•	System learns user habits (e.g., typical consumption rates, preferred storage locations).
	3.	Meal Prep and Consumption:
	•	Cameras detect ingredients being used (e.g., flour container opened, eggs removed).
	•	Inventory is updated automatically, and potential restock alerts are generated.

Challenges and Solutions

	1.	Object Recognition Accuracy:
	•	Challenge: Cameras may struggle with generic packaging or unlabeled items.
	•	Solution: Allow users to correct or label unrecognized items. Over time, the AI learns from corrections.
	2.	Data Redundancy:
	•	Challenge: Receipt parsing and cameras may double-count items.
	•	Solution: Implement cross-verification rules. For example:
	•	Receipt data takes precedence for initial input.
	•	Camera data adjusts real-time stock levels.
	3.	Privacy Concerns:
	•	Challenge: Cameras in kitchens may feel invasive.
	•	Solution: Encrypt all image data and provide settings to disable live feeds or delete footage after analysis.
	4.	Hardware Costs:
	•	Challenge: High upfront costs for cameras and processing power.
	•	Solution: Start with a modular design—users can add cameras to key areas and scale up as needed.

Optional Enhancements

	•	Predictive Restocking: Use consumption patterns and receipt history to predict when users will need to restock.
	•	Meal Plan Integration: Link inventory to recipe suggestions and meal planning.
	•	Voice Assistant Support: Allow users to make corrections or additions via voice commands.
